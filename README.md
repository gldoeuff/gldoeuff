# 👋 Hi, I’m Gabrielle | Engineer Transforming Data into Meaningful Systems

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a physicist-engineer with 6+ years of experience in international R&D, industrial production, and software development — now building my career in **data engineering**, **analytics**, and **data science**.

## 🚀 Why I’m Here
After years of working on instrumentation, calibration systems, automation workflows, and technical documentation, I discovered how data could unlock deeper operational insight and strategic improvements. That sparked my transition toward more data-centric roles — where structure, precision, and learning are everything.

## 🔧 What I Build
My projects are inspired by open learning resources like *Data with Baraa*, which I’ve studied, re-implemented, and adapted to reflect how I think as an engineer.

You’ll find work across the full analytics stack:

- 🗃️ **SQL Data Warehousing**
  ETL pipeline design, dimensional modeling, query optimization — simulating real production environments

- 📈 **Advanced SQL Analytics** 
  Segmentation, performance metrics, trend analysis, and operational insights
  
- 🧹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  Data cleaning, profiling, and early-stage exploration using SQL and open datasets

- 📊 **Tableau Dashboards**  *(coming soon)*
  Visual storytelling for HR and sales use cases — focused on clean logic and communication

- ⚙️ **Personal Engineering Projects** *(coming soon)*  
  Custom experiments inspired by instrumentation logs, QA metrics, and multilingual applications

## 🌱 How I Work
- I prioritize clarity, documentation, and structure.
- I apply engineering logic to create scalable, maintainable systems.
- I believe in honest learning — every project is credited, contextualized, and iterated with purpose.

## 🌍 Multilingual Collaboration
Fluent in **English**, **Spanish**, **French**, and **German** — used professionally in cross-functional settings and technical documentation.

## 🧭 What’s Next
I’m expanding into:
- Python automation and ETL orchestration  
- Data storytelling through clean visual and textual reporting  
- Building personal tools for diagnostics, quality tracking, and sentiment analysis
